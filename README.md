The css changes i've made...
1. color: I changed the p color to a darker gray(#6666) and the btn color to black and a hover state of light gray.
2. background color: to green
3. font: I changed all the h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,p to Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif font-family.
4. box or text shadows: I add a box shaddow to my profile pic
5. transitions or animation:I made the thumbnail to expand on its hover state.
6. add a logo: although its not the best logo, I had added "JJ"to the top of the page!
